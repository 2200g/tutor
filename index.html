	<p>hihi, i'm aadi. <br>
	  in the past couple of years, i have extensively learned a lot in the STEM fields and i'd love to help others learn too.
	  i used to enjoy teaching my peers in school, so i decided to take up teaching as a part-time.
	  i try to teach in simple terms without jargon and i'd like to think that i'm good at being helpful.
	  <br>
	  <b>i can teach you about -</b>
	  </p><ul>
	    <li>mathematics (algebra, calculus, trigonometry, combinatorics, geometry and vectors)</li>
	    <li>physics (electrodynamics and magnetism, mechanics (i enjoy fluids a whole bunch), particle physics)</li>
	    <li>chemistry (organic chemistry (i really love and enjoy organic), physical/inorganic chemistry)</li>
	    <li>i teach for contests, entrances, grades 9-13 (send me your curriculum/syllabus and i shall let you know if i can do it eeee.)</li>
	  </ul>
